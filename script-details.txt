This is a JavaScript UserScript that uses the ajaxHooker library to modify the response from a specific HTTP request.

Here is a detailed breakdown of what each part of the script does:

```// ==/UserScript==```
This is a metadata block that indicates that this is a UserScript. It is used by UserScript managers like Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey to identify and manage the script.

```/* global ajaxHooker*/```
This is a comment that indicates that the script is using a variable called ajaxHooker, which is not defined in this script. This variable is expected to be defined in another script or library that is loaded before this one.

```(function() { ... })();```
This is an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE), which is used to create a new scope for the script. This helps prevent naming conflicts and keeps the global namespace clean.

```'use strict';```
This is a directive that enables strict mode in JavaScript. Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript by disallowing certain actions and enforcing more rigorous syntax rules.

```ajaxHooker.hook(request => { ... });```
This is the main part of the script that modifies the HTTP response. The `ajaxHooker` variable is assumed to refer to a library that provides a `hook` function. This function takes a callback function as its argument, which is called for every HTTP request that matches a certain pattern.

In this script, the callback function checks if the URL of the request ends with the string "get-account-details". If it does, the function modifies the response by setting the `response` property of the `request` object. This property is expected to be a function that takes the HTTP response text as its argument.

```const json=JSON.parse(res.responseText);```
This line parses the HTTP response text as a JSON object.

```const a="data" in json?json.data:json;```
This line extracts a property from the JSON object called "data". If the object has a property called "data", its value is assigned to the `a` variable. Otherwise, the entire JSON object is assigned to `a`.

```a.profile.accepted_premium_modes_tnc=true;```
This line modifies a property of the `a` object called "accepted_premium_modes_tnc" to `true`.

```a.profile.premium=true;```
This line modifies another property of the `a` object called "premium" to `true`.

```res.responseText=JSON.stringify("data" in json?(json.data=a,json):a);```
This line modifies the HTTP response text by stringifying the modified JSON object and assigning it to the `responseText` property of the `res` object. If the original JSON object had a "data" property, the modified `a` object is assigned to it and the entire JSON object is returned. Otherwise, only the modified `a` object is returned.



To summarize, the script intercepts a specific HTTP request and modifies its JSON response by setting two properties (accepted_premium_modes_tnc and premium) to true in the profile object. It then updates the HTTP response text with the modified JSON object.

It's worth noting that this script assumes that the ajaxHooker library is defined elsewhere and that the URL it is targeting (get-account-details) is a valid endpoint on the website it is being used on. Additionally, modifying the HTTP response of a website can have unintended consequences and potentially break the website's functionality, so it's important to be cautious when using scripts like this.
